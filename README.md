# QuickCalculate
Chrome extension allowing quick calculations without leaving a tab. Created because I'm frankly too lazy to pull out my phone
to do quick calculations and don't always want to open another tab.  

TODO:    
  Prevent pressing * twice to result in exponentials - unintended feature  
  Add explicit exponentials - replace in string with "**" perhaps  
  Add parentheses  
  Improve visuals
