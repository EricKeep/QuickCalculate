# QuickCalculate
Chrome extension allowing quick calculations without leaving a tab. Created because I'm frankly too lazy to pull out my phone
to do quick calculations and don't always want to open another tab.

TODO:
  Figure out safe way of evaluating results so it plays nicely with chrome extension  
  Add more functionality (exponents)  
  Improve visuals
